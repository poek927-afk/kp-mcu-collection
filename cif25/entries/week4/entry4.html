      <h3>Why I Love This Movie</h3>
      <p>I love this film because it reminds me of a simler time in my life. I remeber sitting in the theater on an early saturday morning with my dad and being so excited to finally see the sequel Spider-Man movie.
       I had seen homecoming in theaters and loved it so much that I was excited to see the next one. The movie was so much fun and had a great story. I loved the chemistry between Tom Holland and Zendaya.
       The action scenes were also really well done and the special effects were impressive. Overall, it was a great movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Watching it again brought back a lot of good memories and made me appreciate the movie even more.
