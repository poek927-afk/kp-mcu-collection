      <p><strong>Thor: Ragnarok</strong> (2017), directed by Taika Waititi, is the third Thor movie in the MCU. It follows Thor as he discovers that Hela, the Goddess of Death, has returned to Asgard and threatens to destroy his home. With the help of Hulk, Valkyrie, and Loki, Thor must stop her and save Asgard from total destruction.</p>
      <p>The film is vibrant, humorous, and unlike any previous Thor movie. Its neon visuals and cosmic aesthetic give it a unique style in the MCU, combining epic action with a colorful, almost surreal tone.</p>
      
      <h3>Why I Love This Movie</h3>
      <p>I love this movie because it has a great mix of humor and action. The movie is very funny and has a lot of great one-liners. The action scenes are also very well done and the special effects are impressive.
       The movie also has a great cast, with Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, and Mark Ruffalo all giving great performances. Overall, it is a great movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
       Watching it again brought back a lot of good memories and made me appreciate the movie even more. My favorite scene is when Thor and Hulk are fighting in the gladiator arena. The scene is very well choreographed and the special effects are impressive. My girlfriend Maddie wasnt a huge fan of this one and i understand why, but i still enjoyed it.
       the simple, silly humor was really endearing to me.
